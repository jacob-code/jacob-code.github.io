<a href="https://twitter.com/ava__js/status/735538464263950336" target='blank'>We</a> have released an integrated test runner for <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava" target='blank'>AVA</a> that works with <a href="https://atom.io/" target='blank'>Atom</a>, the GitHub editor. AVA is a very cool testing framework, maintained by <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava#team" target='blank'>really talented people</a>, that takes advantage of the async nature of Node to run tests in parallel.

As all the Atom packages, this is effectively a Node application. Atom supports by default the <a href="https://github.com/avajs/atom-ava/blob/master/lib/index.js#L1" target='blank'>transpilation</a> with Babel, so we have used ES6 to write everything.

The communication between AVA and the package is implemented with <a href="https://testanything.org/" target='blank'>TAP</a> (Test anything protocol) using <a href="https://github.com/tapjs/tap-parser" target='blank'>this TAP parser</a>, that worked very well.
At this stage, we don't use any framework or library to render the results, just DOM manipulation.
